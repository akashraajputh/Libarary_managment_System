## 💡 How It Works

1. Admin adds books and registers members.
2. Users can log in, search books, and request to issue/return them.
3. Admin approves transactions and system records them with date and time.
4. If a return is delayed, the system calculates a fine.
5. Both admin and users can view borrowing history and book status.
